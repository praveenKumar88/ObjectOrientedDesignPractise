Assumptions:

- Its assumed that each line is terminated by newline. Ex: Testcase given in question
- Questions are assumed to be end with '?' (without quotes). Ex: how much is glob pish ? 
- Inputs are assumed to be case sensitive. Ex: glob is not GLOB.
- keyword 'is' is assumed as a separator for identifiers and their values in Assignment statement. Ex: glob is I
- Whenever you provide empty line the input process will be terminated and the application will show output.

To Run:

- Execute ./run.sh
- To run tests, make sure you have junit in the classpath and then run java -cp *jar LineProcessorTest or load the project in an IDE and do Run>Run LineProcessorTest.java.

Caution:

- I have not included the junit jar with the submission for security reasons. 
- I have not made run.sh executable with the submission for security reasons.
- Please make sure the classpath is correct before running the application.
- Please do chmod + x run.sh to make it executable. Otherwise you can copy-paste the contents to the command line and execture from there.
